# Titanic ML Playground
Codebase to practice Linear and Logistic Regression using scikit and the Titanic dataset.

## Goals
* Linear Regression w scikit
* Logistic Regression w scikit

## To Do
- [x] Make conda env
  - [ ] ~~Use environment.yml file, see if that resolves requirement.txt issues as well as something like poetry or pixi~~ (Not doing this)
  - [x] Python version? (3.12.7)
- [ ] Install packages
  - [x] Scikit
  - [x] Other? See as you go
- [x] Add dataset
- [x] Find better dataset for linear regression (titanic good for logistic regression)
- [x] Use sk-learn to run linear regression on dataset

# Notes & Tips
- [sklearn has california housing dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html#sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing) (backup lin. reg)


## Dataset
[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heptapod/titanic)
