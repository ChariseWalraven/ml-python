# Titanic ML Playground
Codebase to practice Linear and Logistic Regression using scikit and the Titanic dataset.

## Goals
* Linear Regression w scikit
* Logistic Regression w scikit

## To Do
- [x] Make conda env
  - [ ] ~~Use environment.yml file, see if that resolves requirement.txt issues as well as something like poetry or pixi~~ (Not doing this)
  - [x] Python version? (3.12.7)
- [ ] Install packages
  - [x] Scikit
  - [ ] Other? See as you go
- [x] Add dataset
- [ ] Use sk-learn to run linear regression on dataset
  - [ ] Age v died? Think so


## Dataset
[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heptapod/titanic)
